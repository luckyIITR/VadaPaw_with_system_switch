| Van Der Paw method
| The Van der Paw method is a method for measuring the specific resistivity and Hall effect of flat samples of arbitrary shape, in which contacts are sufficiently small and placed on the circumference of the sample.
| If one is provided with just an SMU, one can achieve all the eight configurations ( V1 - V8 ) by switching the probes manually.
â€¦ 
| In this setup, we have used a system switch to internally switch the connections and achieve the eight configurations. The user just needs to execute the LabView code once, and it switches internally and generates all 8 configurations and takes the corresponding voltage readings. Additionally, this can be done for different sets of current values.

Switching mechanism:
|  The Hall effect card inside the system switch contains a matrix grid, which looks like:

| By closing appropriate cross-points, one can generate the various configurations. Primitively, one can do this manually on the switch, this code automates the process.

| For the automation, we connect the devices via GPIB and type-B cables to the system and install their drivers. The details are given in the manual.

| The instructions for use are given in the Manual.
