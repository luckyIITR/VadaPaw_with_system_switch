| Van Der Paw method
| The Van der Paw method is a method for measuring the specific resistivity and Hall effect of flat samples of arbitrary shape, in which contacts are sufficiently small and placed on the circumference of the sample.
| If one is provided with just an SMU, one can achieve all the eight configurations ( V1 - V8 ) by switching the probes manually.
â€¦ 
| In this setup, we have used a system switch to internally switch the connections and achieve the eight configurations. Hence, once the probes are inserted into the sample, there is to switch them further, instead, just one execution of the LabView code will generate the 8 configurations automatically within minutes. Additionally, this can be done for different sets of current values.

| The instructions for use are given in the Manual.
